## Installation

### Install Packer
- run `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim`
- run `:PackerSync`

### Install Mason LSPs
- run `:MasonInstall intelephense lua-language-server tailwindcss-language-server`

### Obs:
You need to install NodeJs in your machine to install intelephense.
My personal sugest is to use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install NodeJs.
Look at the fucking documentation to install that, after does that, run:


``` bash
    nvm install node
    nvm use node
    node -v
    npm -v
```
You should see the version of node and npm.

If it doesn't work, search on internet how to install fucking NodeJS.
